# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

Visualization of different sorting algorithms in C++ with SDL2 Library.

Description: A sorting algorithm arranges list items in a specific order. While many sorting algorithms exist, we'll focus on a few common ones in this visualizer. These include Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Heap Sort. The list size is always 130 elements. You can randomize the list and pick a sorting algorithm from the options. They all sort items in ascending order, but the displayed sorting time might differ from their actual efficiency.

# How to Run

Currently, you can only run the Sorting Visualizer using the C++ source code available in the repository. This would require the installation of the SDL2 library. I recommend folowing codergopher's tutorial on Youtube to setup SDL2.-> [How to download and setup SDL2 Library](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsG6dJlLBDw&list=PL2RPjWnJduNmXHRYwdtublIPdlqocBoLS&ab_channel=codergopher) After setting up the SDL2 library, just include the Sorting Visualizer.cpp file from the repository in your project with the build options as mentioned in the tutorial and build and run the project
